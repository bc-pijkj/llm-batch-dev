# Usage

The README covers the basics. This page collects the
longer examples and the notes that did not fit up front.

## Basic

```bash
python batch.py prompts.jsonl -o answers.jsonl --workers 4 --rpm 300
```

## Notes

- 4xx fails fast; 429 and 5xx retry with jittered backoff
- Real rate limiting: sliding windows on requests/min and tokens/min
